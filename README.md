   # Todo List in Vanilla JavaScript

- As a user I want to remove a todo from the list so I can keep my list as clean and short as possible.

- As a user I want to be able to move todos up and down in order to prioritize what I have to do.


Bonus User Stories _(not mandatory, but might give you a good challenge)_

- As a user I want to be able to put my name _(author of a todo)_ on a todo, so everyone in my family can add their own todos to the todo list.

- As a user I want to be able to edit existing todos in case I remember something that has to do with a specific todo.

- As a user I want a timestamp to be added to my new todos in order better se how old all the todos are.

- As a user I want to be able to sort my todos after either timestamp or author.
